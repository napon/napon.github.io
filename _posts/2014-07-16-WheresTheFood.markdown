description: <img src="img/portfolio/wtf-1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="vibernate poster">WheresTheFood is a web application that allows users to view local food vendors in Vancouver. We are using Food Vendors Data Catalogue provided by the city of Vancouver together with Google Maps API to create an easy-to-navigate map view where each marker on the map represents a food vendor location. Users can click on each marker to view more details about the food vendor as well as their hours of operation which are fetched from Yelp API.<br><br>Each user can log into their Google Account to add and edit personal favourite food truck locations. They can also attach a short memo for each food truck for things like their orders and special deals. This information is stored and loaded the next time the user logs back in. Finally we are integrating Facebook to allow users to share their favourite food trucks with friends on Facebook.<br><br>Given the size of the project, we decided on using BackboneJS because of it's simplicity as well as using Firebase for real-time data sync and storage.
tasks: <ul class="text-left"><li>Parsed JSON dataset of local food trucks in Vancouver and stored on the server-side along with users' information.</li><li>Implemented Facebook integration and login to allow users to like, favourite, add comments and memos for different food trucks.</li><li>Implemented a search functionality that allows users to look up food trucks and filter based on ratings and distance from the user</li><li>Integrated Google Maps API to plot food trucks on an interactive map</li></ul>
