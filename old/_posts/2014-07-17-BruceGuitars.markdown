This project is a redesign of the existing Bruce Guitars website as part of MyPlanet's fellowship program.<br><br>After talking to Bruce and conducting interviews with some of his customers, we noticed a clear disconnect in Bruce's site experience and the intimate experience his customers find in-store. With this in mind, we rethought the flow of the site’s content to be more intuitive and presents Bruce's passion for his business and his customers.
tasks: <ul class="text-left"><li>Implemented the dynamic loading of HTML5 video backgrounds based on the user’s interaction with different elements on the site.</li><li>Collaborated with the designers in implementing the interactivity and functionality of the website.</li></ul>
